	<p><indent>Sugar Jack was formed in 2005 by singer/guitarist Jon Mickey and bassist Eric Plantholt.  The band was formed with the intention of playing music, both covers and originals, that both band members and audiences could feel connected to.  Tragically, Jon Mickey  was lost in a car accident in 2014.  Eric and drummer Tony Bruno wanted to continue the band in Jon's memory.  Tony DiLorenzo rejoined the band, Keith Lee was added as the lead singer and Matt Bressler was added to the band as a guitarist to round out the group. </indent></p>
