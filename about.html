	<p>You're alive and I'm alive.  You're a dream that I had when I was young.  I'm alive and I"m OK.  The air is light blue today.  The air is light blue today.  But really I know inside it's all the same in death.  But my mind is mine for now</p>

	<p>
	  I never asked to be here at all so why do I have to face the fear of losing it?  Of losing why I live?  And if I just leave I'd already be gone.  I told you everything that I had the chance to.

	<p>	Some stuff about Eric. blah blah blah does this work right super text long long long this needs to be longer to test the margins blah blah blah.  some text takes up the whole screen because that's what i'll have to do later and i want to make sure it looks alright.  when i say nothing it's just because i like the sound of it.  is there anything more beautiful than afternoons or a quiet summer night while the rainstorm gently cries.  </p>

The light I lose that loves me even though I bring the dark when I can't feel that I am warm.  And i look inside just to see that there's nothing more but there's blue in the stars even though i'll never go past the window past the water past the eyes inside my skull that will surely show me love </p>

Like my mother plays the lottery till I get rich some other way or she wins it. And there is someone out there just like me probably keeping to themselves but I know CPR and I know mouth to mouth when your legs give in and your lungs give out I will blow air into your open mouth baby I can spit this game all day.</p>

	<p> I got miles to go before I ever get home but the sound of your laugh and your voice on the phone makes me feel like I'm already there.  I got so stoned I fell asleep in the front seat I never sleep in the front seat I'm too tall but I got so stoned I fell asleep in the front seat I never sleep in the front seat I'm too tall but I got so stoned I fell asleep in the front seat.
